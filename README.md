This is a tool for University of Toronto Studetns(me) who need to enrol course in Acorn<br/>
However, this should not be used as it is unfair to other students and it violates the university policy. Also, I should rewrite it in Airflow to manage the opereations better.<br/>

Dependency:<br/>
selenium<br/>


USE:<br/>
1:create a file called data_enrol.txt<br/>
